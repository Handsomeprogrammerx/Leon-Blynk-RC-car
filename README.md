# Leon-Blynk-RC-car
A remote-controlled car which can be operated via a smartphone using the Blynk application. Designed for experimentation with wireless control systems and real-time response.


## Skills Highlighted
-Logic debugging:  Diagnosed and resolved connection issues with the ESP8266 WiFi module, identified correct motor control pins through systematic testing, and implemented a timer function to ensure non-blocking operation and prevent control interruptions.

-C++ programming: Wrote a custom program through Arduino IDE.

-Hardware tinkering: wiring, component selection, and module interfacing.

## Status
Currently paused â€” preserving the project framework for future applications or upgrades (e.g., RC lawn mover, camera).
